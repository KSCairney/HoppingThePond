			<p class="Text">After about a year and half in London, my time was coming to a close. I had traveled a bit around England, hopped over to Ireland twice and made a brief escape to Rome. I had visions of visiting all of Europe in that year and a half, but my mistaken expectations about how busy my university would keep me in London most of the time. Though if there is a place to be trapped, London is a good choice. Speaking of traps; one place my beer-enthusiast side always hoped to visit was just a eurostar away in Belgium.</p>

			<p class="Text">As any beer connoisseur/alcoholic will tell you, Belgium is home to some amazing and unique styles of beer. Something recently recognized by UNESCO, as they have declared Belgian beer a national heritage. We have all come across Stella and likely Chimay, Hoegaarden or Leffe. and probably even Duvel. While these beers are lovely first glimpse at Belgian beer, they are but the tip of the iceberg. I had heard of the mystical Delirium Village, legendary beers available only at the Abbey for those with a Belgian license plate, I was under the impression that Belgium was a beer drinkers paradise. This isn't far from the truth, at least for those who enjoy the sweet or sour Belgian brews. A trip to almost any city could leave one completely content to bar hop looking for obscure beers for days; unfortunately we were limited to a long weekend.</p>

            <p class="Text">With a list of bars a mile long, provided by Emily's father, we made our way across the channel to Brussels for the night. Our first impression, traveling from Brussels station to our hotel near the main square, was a strange trip. The long road was filled with men smoking and chatting, none with a beer in hand and no women to be seen. I was left wondering if Belgium really was the beer heaven I had imagined. Before crashing for the evening we headed for the nearest bar on our list, referred to as "the creepy puppet pub" but more accurately titled Poechenellekelder. The description was apt as the walls inside the pub were covered by marionettes; not wanting the lifeless spectators we opted for a seat outside in the the little square. After a not-really-that-long trip, I finally got to have my first Belgian beer in Belgium and somehow still wound up with a glass of the not-so-rare Kasteel rouge.</p>

            <p class="Text">We failed to get a clear glimpse of Brussels until the following morning, when we could finally take in the Grand Place or Grote Markt in all its glory. The square in the morning light was far more impressive than the night before, and we quickly discovered that the creepy puppet pub stood directly opposite the Manneken Pis, one of Brussels most famous sights. For those not familiar with the Manneken Pis, it is a small statue of a child urinating, it was originally built in 1388, but the statue their presently was built in about 1619. It had gone unnoticed by us due to its tiny size and the darkness of the street, but in full daylight we were left wondering how it had garnered so much fame.</p>

            <p class="Text">We didn't come all the way to Belgium to sightsee, we were on a quest for Belgian beer, so after a day of taking in the sights we made our way to the Delirium Village. Located not far from the Grote Markt, the Delirium Village is more of an alley than a village but features an amazing selection of bars. The Delirium Monasterium featuring all Belgian abbey ales, the Taphouse with a vast draft selection, the Hoppy Loft of Pale Ales and my favorite in the basement with the phonebook sized tome of all their different bottled beers. This same bar in 2004 set the record for the most different beer available at one time, setting the record at the convenient number of 2,004.</p>

            <p class="Text">Still on our feet after hopping around the village we went with some friends to find La Port Noire located in a dark brick cellar. La Port Noire was far quieter than the more central bars or the Delirium Village, but they featured an equally impressive list of beers. I chatted with friends in the darkness nursing my equally dark Troubadour Imperial Stout, a delicious but whopping 9.2% on the tail end of a day of drinking. Together we decided we had fully slaked our thirst, and so we caught a late evening train to Bruges, and our UFO-themed hotel room that awaited us next to Bruges station.</p>

            <p class="Text">Though I enjoyed my day in Brussels, it's beauty was slight when compared to the quaint and quiet Bruges in October. The main square still features its fair share of crowds, but the cold made the town's mornings and late evening desolate. Trying to rest for a bit and not jump straight into the beer, we spent that first bruges morning viewing the various historical locales. We explored the main square for breakfast, made friends with the local horses and viewed a vial of possibly-Christ's blood at Basilica of the Holy Blood. We attempted view the entirety Bruges from the top of the Belfry famously featured in the film In Bruges. When buying tickets to the top we discovered the that Emily's and my age straddled the concessions tickets cutoff, and not knowing how to explain we wanted a ticket at each price, Emily asked for "one adult, and oneâ€¦   child?", to which the woman selling the tickets found highly amusing.</p>

            <p class="Text">After an amazing view, slightly obscured by safety nets we went in search for our first Bruges beer. We had been recommended the best beer in Belgium, an incredibly rare brew found solely in one hard-to-find pub in Bruges. We were told it was just off the main square, but failed to find it. We walked up and down the supposed street looking at all the various shops, but found now De Garre bar. Once we finally accepted our fate, we ran across town and signed up for the De Halve Maan brewery tour.  The tour itself was short, but featured a free beer and some good views of the city. The De Halve Maan beers were all solid, but what we took in most was the tour guides recommendation of the bar 't Brugs Beetje. We trusted that woman giving Brewery tours in Beer laden Belgium would have good taste in local bars, and she did. I had the chance to try the memorable Oude Gueze and Troublette, as well as an assortment of great, but less memorable beers I had never heard of.</p>

            <p class="Text">Before catching the train we went to the strange Bruges Chocolate Museum (Choco-Story), filled with Play Mobile dioramas. Later we asked why Emily's father had recommended the museum, to which he said "I know, I was just listing the places I went." Luckily none of his listed bars were at all disappointing. On our way back to the train station we made one last pass at the supposed location of De Garre, and this time we decided to checkout the tiny doorway that seemed to lead to someoneâ€™s house. To our surprise the little doorway opened up and featured the little bar to our right next to the canal. I must say, that I often assume the hype ensures a good beer, but rarely much better than the readily-available, De Garre is where I am wrong. To this day I would argue that De Garreâ€™s house beer is an easy contender for the best beer I have ever had.</p>

            <p class="Text">The train brought us back to Brussels and before our evening Eurostar back to London we stopped into the Cantillon Brewery. Cantillon is famous for its lambics and the brewery features a selection of rarities hard to acquire outside of Brussels. The lambics are famous for their sour sweet taste and are often brewed with various fruits to change their style. The yeast isn't controlled like most beer, but instead left to the wild. If you are unfamiliar with a lambic, they are a delicious but very unique tasting beer. Despite all the fruit varieties, I still prefer the non-fruity gueuze. The Cantillon brewery was our last stop and a delicious and memorable beer-cation. Maybe because we didnâ€™t want to leave, or maybe due to customs moving slowly, but we were forced to literally run for our train back to England.</p>
