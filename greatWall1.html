			</div>
			<br>
			<p class="Text">My three visits to the Great Wall have been fairly eventful. Much like my trips to Kyoto each trip came during a different time of year; winter being the only season I've missed. My first visit came during the spring of 2009, at the beginning of a big solo trip. China was the first of the 5 Asian countries I was about to tour. I was incredibly excited at this early stage of my adventure. My friend Christina, who I met while living in South Korea, having never been to Beijing either, said she would join me for the first leg.</p>
            <p class="Text">After an initial set back at the airport, we were unable to locate each other due to completely underestimating the size and the distance between terminals. We did finally reunite after a far too long period of panic, and together we successfully found the bus we needed to the city. Unfortunately, we got off at the wrong stop by mistake. Unsure of our whereabouts we sought assistance from a passerby only then to discover that we had alighted too early. After managing to flag down a taxi, we pointed to the hostel on a map and crossed our fingers. We were relieved when we reached our destination just shy of five hours after landing. It wasn't the best start, and I was hoping this wasn't a sign of things to come.</p>

			</div>
            <p class="Text">We stayed at the lovely Peking Downtown Backpackers Accommodation located in the central hutong. After a good night's sleep, we rose early and filled our bellies to prepare for our full day of climbing ahead. With my mammoth guide book of China in hand, small sticky notes on the pages relating to the wall and the 'useful Chinese expressions', we took a short walk to the bus station. Trying to navigate the daunting Deshengmen bus station is no easy task, but we somehow located the correct numbered bus to the popular section of the wall, Badaling. This section of the Great Wall was unbelievably packed and took nearly two hours to reach; although it would have taken an hour if we hadn't accidentally hopped on the, albeit correct numbered, bus going in the opposite direction. As it turns out, public transport in Beijing wasn't either of our strong suits.</p>

            <p class="Text">After the scenic detour we were dropped off a 20 minute stroll from the entrance of the wall. We resisted all conveniently situated sounvenir stalls leading the way up and arrived at the surprisingly tranquil destination, but it soon got lively. The tour buses destined for 10 am arrival started unloading throngs of people all excited about encountering the famous sight.</p>

			</div>
            <p class="Text">At the entrance of Badaling there is a large plaque where we waited patiently for families and tour groups to pose for pictures, and at an opportune moment followed suit. Badaling is the most completed section of the wall, you can walk for 2.3 miles (3.74 km) and go through 19 watchtowers. Due to its ease of access and relatively complete form, it is also the most popular section. Most tour groups are given limited time at the wall and so donâ€™t seem to venture far along it. So if you have the leg power, you can reach more discreet areas where you can take snaps of the wall, rather than just swarms of people.</p>

			</div>
            <p class="Text">We decided to take the north section, which was a work out; steep steps, sloping up and down across the mountains. Apparently, the south section is easier, unfortunately I found this piece of information out later.</p>
            <p class="Text">We were expecting signs of spring as it was April, but were surprised to see a barren landscape. Apparently, spring comes late in Badaling, and we had come too early. It didn't really matter though, we could still appreciate the impressive Great Wall. Though visibility was poor, possibly due to fog or pollution, the wall and watchtowers draping the mountains in the distance could still be seen. A wonderful and unique view, and for a first time viewer it was breathtaking.</p>
