			<p class="Text">Where to begin? So yeah, to state the obvious, I love to travel and I was inspired to see the world from a very young age. I remember staring at my dolls from all over Europe, including the former Yugoslavia, gifts that my grandparents had brought me from their travels. The feeling of excitement on their return to hear all about their travels remains with me; and oh boy my grandad can talk, no stone was ever left unturned when recalling their adventures.  Many of their holidays were road trips and they would play everything by ear, moving on when they felt like it. They would sometimes travel with friends and family all the while meeting and making friends along the way. My grandad jabbering away to everyone he comes across and my sweet kind nan offering a cuppa to anyone in ears shot, is a scenario, I imagine not that far from the truth.</p>
			<p class="Text">My parents took my brother and I on some wonderful trips around the UK and Europe, weirdly one of my favourite places to visit as a child was practically in my backyard. My mum asking me 'where do you want to go on holiday?' and me with the same response for many years in a row "BUTLINS!", to which I often didn't get my own way. Like a lot of kids looking around museums, castles, ruins and cathedrals didn't enthrall me, I preferred to go horse trekking, play on the beach, go to water parks while locating and purchasing my next new cuddly toy. I would often write a travel diary, which to be honest, I was pretty rubbish at and it often resulted in my parents having to remind me of what we did many days later and spelling out the names of places we visited. I made foreign friends when we went to Europe, some spoke English and some didn't, not that that made a difference to me as I would gabber away to them whether they were 'listening' or not.</p>
			<p class="Text">I'm from a small town in England called Newark-on-Trent and growing up there was fine but it's just too small and familiar to me now. A trip I took to London while in my teens made me want to move and live in the big city, I recall telling my mum that 'one day I will live here'; it was so exciting to me and I couldn't wait to grow up and leave Newark. I have since lived in Aberdeen, Prague, Seoul, London, Zibo and Tokyo, the latter three with my husband Kenny with whom I am currently living in Los Angeles. As a result, many of my friends and family are scattered across the globe. The advantages to this though, whenever I travel, I usually get to reunite with some wonderful individuals.</p>
			<p class="Text">I have really only seen a tiny snippet of the world, visited about 30 countries, some of them several times, and just a few states in the US. The countries I have lived in, I have travelled extensively. Living abroad has allowed me to really see a country and learn about their culture, language and their people; the main reasons for my drive to travel.</p>
			<p class="Text">The highlights of my travels so far are endless, from riding on a moped while temple hopping in Siem Reap, being completely mesmorised by the beauty of Dubrovnik, feeding wallabies in Adelaide, hiking in Sapa, supping beer in Bruges, surfing in Agadir, snowboarding in the Pyrenees, climbing the Great Wall three times and not falling to my death into the Grand Canyon.</p>
